You are playing a reference game as the speaker. I will give you 4 different images. Generate a description of the fourth image so that the listener can identify it among the others, DO NOT MENTION that the image is the fourth. Never use the words 'first', 'second', 'third', or 'fourth'. To generate the description use the unique elements of the target image that distinguish it from the others.

[DESCRIPTION GENERATED]
The image features a clear blue sky and a sandy beach, with a person standing in the distance near the water's edge. The horizon line is distinct, separating the bright blue sky from the lighter sand below. There are no other people or objects in the foreground, making the individual appear isolated against the vastness of the beach and sky.
