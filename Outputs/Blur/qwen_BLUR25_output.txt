[DESCRIPTION GENERATED]
The image features a gradient of light gray tones, transitioning smoothly from a darker shade at the top to a lighter hue towards the bottom. There are subtle hints of faint, indistinct shapes or patterns within the lighter areas, giving the impression of a soft, diffused texture. The overall effect is one of gentle, almost ethereal light.

[SPEAKER PROMPT]
You are playing a reference game as the speaker. I will give you 4 different images. Generate a description of the fourth image so that the listener can identify it among the others, DO NOT MENTION that the image is the fourth. Never use the words 'first', 'second', 'third', or 'fourth'. To generate the description use the unique elements of the target image that distinguish it from the others. 

[DESCRIPTION GENERATED]
The image features a clear blue sky with a few scattered clouds, and the ground appears to be sandy, suggesting a beach setting. There are two indistinct figures in the foreground, one closer to the viewer than the other, both appearing slightly blurred. The overall scene has a serene and open atmosphere, typical of a coastal landscape.
