[RAW SPEAKER PROMPT]
<|grounding|> You are playing a reference game as the speaker. I will give you 4 different images. Image 1: <image>
 Image 2: <image>
 Image 3: <image>
 Image 4: <image>

Generate a description of the fourth image so that the listener can identify it among the others, DO NOT MENTION that the image is the fourth. Never use the words 'first', 'second', 'third', or 'fourth'. To generate the description use the unique elements of the target image that distinguish it from the others.
