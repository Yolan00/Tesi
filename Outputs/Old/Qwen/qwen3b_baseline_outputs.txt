You are playing a reference game as the speaker. I will give you 4 different images. Generate a description of the first image so that the listener can identify it among the others, DO NOT MENTION that the image is the first. Never use the words 'first', 'second', 'third', or 'fourth'. To generate the description use the unique elements of the target image that distinguish it from the others. 

[DESCRIPTION GENERATED]
A man in a white cap and black shorts stands on the beach, holding a yellow frisbee, while another man in a green swim cap and black shorts runs towards him with a red frisbee. The ocean waves crash onto the shore behind
