This is the second round of the game. 
Your previous description was: "A small airplane soars through a clear sky, framed by a square border, with its wings angled slightly upward, suggesting a gentle climb. The background is a soft gradient of light blue to white, providing a stark contrast to the plane's dark silhouette" but the listener is still not sure about the target image and selected multiple possible targets. 
Generate a new description of IMAGE 1 taking into account the other images, so that the listener can identify it among the others. 
DO NOT MENTION that the image is IMAGE 1. Never use the words 'first', 'second', etc.

The pony has a fluffy mane and tail, and the person appears to be holding a camera." but the listener is still not sure about the target image and selected multiple possible targets. 
Generate a new description of IMAGE 1 taking into account the other images, so that the listener can identify it among the others. 
DO NOT MENTION that the image is IMAGE 1. Never use the words 'first', 'second', etc.

You are playing a reference game as the speaker. I will give you 3 images. 
This is the second round of the game. 
Your previous description was: "A nighttime scene at a train station platform illuminated by a bright overhead light. A train is stopped on the tracks, with its headlights and windows reflecting the light. The platform sign reads "161 St." and points towards "168 St" but the listener is still not sure about the target image and selected multiple possible targets. 
Generate a new description of IMAGE 1 taking into account the other images, so that the listener can identify it among the others. 
DO NOT MENTION that the image is IMAGE 1. Never use the words 'first', 'second', etc.
