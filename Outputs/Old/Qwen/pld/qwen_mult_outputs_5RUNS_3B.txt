Your previous description was: "A young girl in a white and blue striped tank top and red skirt stands on a tennis court, holding a blue and white tennis racket with her right hand, ready to play." but the listener is still not sure about the target image and selected multiple possible targets. 
Generate a new description of IMAGE 1 taking into account the other images, so that the listener can identify it among the others. 
DO NOT MENTION that the image is IMAGE 1. Never use the words 'first', 'second', etc.

You are playing a reference game as the speaker. I will give you 3 images. 
This is the second round of the game. 
Your previous description was: "The monkey in this image has a more pronounced pinkish-red face and is sitting on a rocky surface with sparse vegetation in the background. The banana peel is clearly visible in its hand." but the listener is still not sure about the target image and selected multiple possible targets. 
Generate a new description of IMAGE 1 taking into account the other images, so that the listener can identify it among the others. 
DO NOT MENTION that the image is IMAGE 1. Never use the words 'first', 'second', etc.

You are playing a reference game as the speaker. I will give you 3 images. 
This is the second round of the game. 
Your previous description was: "The slice of pizza in this image features a golden-brown crust with a generous amount of melted cheese and a variety of toppings, including what appears to be green bell peppers and possibly mushrooms. The cheese is slightly browned in some areas, indicating it" but the listener is still not sure about the target image and selected multiple possible targets. 
Generate a new description of IMAGE 1 taking into account the other images, so that the listener can identify it among the others. 
DO NOT MENTION that the image is IMAGE 1. Never use the words 'first', 'second', etc.

The room features a large flat-screen TV on a wooden entertainment center, a comfortable arm" but the listener is still not sure about the target image and selected multiple possible targets. 
Generate a new description of IMAGE 1 taking into account the other images, so that the listener can identify it among the others. 
DO NOT MENTION that the image is IMAGE 1. Never use the words 'first', 'second', etc.
